1.ATLIQ SUPPLY CHAIN DASHBOARD:
𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:
AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Created a 𝘥𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘣𝘰𝘢𝘳𝘥 including important key metrics as a KPI visual comparing its target value and other visuals to represent order, customer and product details
I hope I improved designing skills and used right visuals for relevant fields and measures.

A special thanks to Dhaval Patel Hemanand Vadivel for conducting this challenge as it really helps us question about our analytical skills and ability to design better .I would also like to thank my brother like buddy NAVEEN S for motivating me through my tough time and clarified my doubts patiently while creating design .

What I learnt?
Learnt how to keep our design simple and neat
Learnt how to utilise bookmarks and page navigation
